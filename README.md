# What the Food - A Fast-Food Price Estimator

The basis of this project is to estimate price of whichever fast food by using Machine Learning methodologies. The main idea of that project which has been constructed with Convolutional Neural Network concept that is one of the most popular concept in Machine Learning community is to interpret a given image as basic classification problems with using pre-learned Neural Networks and make price assesment with respect to result of these interpretations.

I have preferred to choose PFID : Pittsburg Fast Food Image Dataset which was published in 2010. PFID contains 4545 images of fast food, 606 stereo pairs, 303 360 degree videos. It's picked 1960 fast food photos which were captured in laboratory environment for the learning part. 75% of whole images (1470 images) had been used for training operation in this data set, which contains more than 100 products from 13 fast food companies, and the remaining 25% (490 images) for validation.

This project was implemented on MathConvNet platform which is an effective Machine Learning library of MATLAB. (http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/)
